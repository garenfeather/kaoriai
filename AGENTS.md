# Repository Guidelines

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use UTF-8 encoding across JSON, JSONL, and Markdown. Indent JSON with two spaces and maintain deterministic key ordering when tooling allows. Stick to snake_case for object keys, kebab-case for new filenames, and append timestamps or UUIDs for session exports. Preserve chronological ordering in log files; only append new entries and never rewrite history.

## Agent Interaction & Communication
Document authors, reviewers, and automated agents must respond in Chinese for user-facing discussions. Always reply in Chinese, even when summarizing English content, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
